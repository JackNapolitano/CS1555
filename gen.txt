****This was on the rubric, because it says "for each attribute of each table" I read that to mean a breakdown of every attribute.
**
**Include a file named “gen.txt” in your
**repository that describes (at a high level) your approach to generating data for each attribute
**of each table of your example database. Be sure to include any assumptions you make in
**this file.

*****Let me know if you guys read this differently.********************************************************
